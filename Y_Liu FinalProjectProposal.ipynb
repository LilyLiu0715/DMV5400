Basically, in the Introduction you are trying to make the reader understand why the research questions you are going to propose are relevant and should be of interest to them.*"

    "If the data improve that economic freedom is related to the money growth and too much government control harmed the sound money. I think this would be a reference when government or organization want to make polices on the economic freedom. Also, I would take a deep look to research the two factors: legal system and property rights,regulation. I persume the two attributes are corelated to the sound money. This would provide the detailed suggestion to the governments and organizations which aspects that they might want to focus on."
